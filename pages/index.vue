      I am software developer currently based in Georgia. I am passionate about using programming
      tools to help people solve their problems. By leveraging my technical skills, I can create
      innovative solutions that streamline operations, improve efficiency, and drive growth for
      businesses. My goal is to empower others to achieve their objectives through the power of
      technology. I really enjoy with feel of creating something new and useful. I am always looking
      for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

      When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy playing basketball. I play every weekend at the park
      near my house. Sometimes I play with my friends, sometimes with strangers. My friend got me
      into it, because he loves sports. I didn't like it at first, because it was hard and lost all
      the time (like programming), but now I enjoy it. I also like to read books and watch series.
